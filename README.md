# PERCS
This repo is dedicated to enabling PERCS collaborators to easily access large datasets from the cloud using the geemap Python package, developped by Qiusheng Wu.

One of the challenges of sharing large spatial datsets is enabling them to be quickly visualised, while also easily shareable. This challenge is resolved by Google Earth Engine, and its ability to provide users the ability to upload their own raster and vector datasets. Google Earth Engine already plays host to relevant and important datasets such as Canada's annual frop inventory (AAFC) [link](https://code.earthengine.google.com/57b199c38650b51880cd884924fc62f4).
